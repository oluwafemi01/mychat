I reasoned that before we can build a chat application that stores username and chats in a database, the chat should first
have a registeration landing page for it to have their username and other details stored in the database, which allows users
to be able to login and logout anytime.
once a user is logged in or register, on their homepage, i made an assumptions of having four buttons  which are for
creating channel, viewing your created channel, viewing all created channel, posting chats on desired channel.

create channel button - this button takes you to a page that allows you to create a chat(forum) where people you or people
can post chat to.

view your channel button - this button takes you to a page listing a the channels created by you, and clicking on the 
viewing link on each channels will take you to the channel's page where you can post and see all the chats related to the
channel

view all channel button - this button takes you to the page listing all the channels available including the ones created 
by other users, and clicking on the viewing link on each channels will take you to the channel's page where you can post 
and see all the chats related to the channel

chat button - this button takes you to the page where you can post your chat and have options to select the channel you
want to post your chats to.

basically i have four custom Apps - account, chat, homesite, post
account app - this app takes care user loggin or registration, it has the form file for registeration and login
post app - this apps has the models for creating channels
chat app - this app has the models for posting chats in channels
homesite app - this has the views,urls and templates for all the pages display on the chat
